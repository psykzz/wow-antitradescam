# AntiTradeScam

> Very simple small addon that forces two click trades

How
Enforces both parties to click an additional popup, by adding and removing currency from the trade.

Once a trade has a currency, it requires the user to click the additional "are you sure" popup.

Anything else
Nope thats the entire thing. You can review the code [directly](https://github.com/psykzz/wow-antitradescam/blob/main/core.lua#L7-L10).
